  BEWARE: GIMMICK!!

  If you run Linux and work on the console occasionally, you probably love
  commandline tools. If you further develop PHP scripts, then you probably
  sometimes wish to test PHP functions on the fly and more easily (without
  typing yet another test script).

  If that's the case, here is a simple script to simplify this. To install
  follow these steps:


  1. Create a $HOME/bin/php directory
     (and add ~/bin/php/ to your shell PATH, of course)

  2. Move the contents of this ./ dir into ~/bin/php/

  3. Run "./make_symlinks" in this directory.

  4. Eventually adapt the interpreter shebang #! in the PhpFuncCall script.


  This will create a lot of symlinks to the "PhpFunctionCall" script. You
  then can run PHP functions on the terminal like:


   localhost:~$   base64_encode  AbcDef_1234


  Of course this is not useful for all PHP functions, because some must be
  used in conjunction or do not return displayable results. And some have
  already been removed from the list. You can of course create special PHP
  scripts, like the example 'phpecho' that call other PHP code or function
  groups, of course.

  If you run an older PHP version, then -sure-, you might want to include
  upgrade.php from within 'PhpFunctionCall'.

  No. Using that under Windows with its frustrating commandline window makes
  little sense.
